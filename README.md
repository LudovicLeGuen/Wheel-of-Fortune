## Introduction
The wheel of Fortune game is the 3rd Portfolio Project of Code institute.  The developper has chosen this theme because it is a game that everybody knows or at least has heard of and because the rules are pretty universaly understood.

The requirement of this project is simple:
* "build a command-line application that allows the user to manage a common dataset about a particular domain".

## UX
### Ideal User Demographic
There are two types of ideal users:
* Frequent user
* New user

### User-Stories
#### Frequent User Goals
* As a frequent user, I want a game that resembles the original wheel of fortune in game play.
* As a frequent user, I want a challenging game.
* As a frequent user, I want to have new experiences and discover new things when playing.

#### New User Goals
* As a new user, I want the commands to be clear.
* As a new user, I want to understand the rules.
* As a new user, I want a fun experience.

### Development-Planes
To build a command-line application that answer all aforementionned needs.

#### Strategy
The game will focus on the following target audience
* Audience
    * New Users
    * Experienced players
    
* Demographic
    * All ages
    
* Psycho Characteristics
    * Curious
    * Determined
    * Puzzle solver
    * competitor

All Users must be able to:
* Play the wheel of fortune
* Insert a player name
* Read the rules
* Choose the number of round
* Restart a game at will
* Know who is winning
* Play each round with a random sentence to guess 
* Choose whether they want to guess a consonant, a vowel or the sentence itself
* See the results of their guesses
* And, certainly the most iconic move of the original, being able to turn the wheel of fortune itself
    
The Administrator has to receive these information:
    * The name of the players
    * The number of rounds to be played
    
#### Scope

Now that we have established the goals of the game we can deduce the necessary features:
* Required functionality
    * Name input
    * Number of round imput
    * A random sentence creator
    * A score board
    * A function to choose between consonant and vowels
    * A function to guess the sentence
    * Turning the wheel
    * Calculating the rewards
    * Printing the players guesses

### Design
The design of a command line application is by nature pretty basic, but the developper has decided to highlight the sentence during the game since it is the mot important factor for the player.
The sentence is therefore "wrapped" between two lines made of the * characters and spaces.

Moreover, the devlopper has decided to isert a printing effect to add a feeling of continuity to the game. This effect gives the player the sensation to be in a narrated game.

The developper has also decided to add a Game Host in the person of Mr Boty to even more emulate the TV game.

### Features to Implement in the future
* More players
     Only 2 players can play now but the real show has 3. a feature to ask how many people can play would be fun.
